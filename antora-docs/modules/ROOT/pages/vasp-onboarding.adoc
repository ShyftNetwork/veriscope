= How to onboard to Veriscope as a VASP
:navtitle: Getting Started

There are several steps a VASP needs to complete to join the Veriscope network and meet their Travel Rule obligations. These are outlined below.

== VASP Onboarding Steps

* mailto:veriscope@shyft.network[Contact Veriscope] and sign relevant agreement(s)
* Install & run a Node
* Create a VASP/Trust Anchor account and request it to be verified
* Login to Node Dashboard and submit VASP IVMS data
* Register VASP Discovery Layer data
* Implement the Veriscope APIs and related business logic
* Test the end-to-end flow
* Request to be onboarded to mainnet

Once the above is done, a VASP will be able to:

. Post attestations (i.e. an intent to withdraw funds to a particular address)
. Listen & respond to attestations on relevant (deposit) addresses
. Initate & share data peer-to-peer between VASPs
