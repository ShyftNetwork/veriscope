:navtitle: Introduction

Veriscope ships with a number of services (all open sourced) that in tandem enable VASPs to:

include::partial$veriscope-enables-vasps-to.adoc

In order to accomplish the above, Veriscope utilizes a number of *self-managed services (illustrated below):*

* *Shyft Relay Node:* a Nethermind Proof Of Authority (POA) client that synchronizes with the Shyft Network. Veriscope communicates with the Relay Node over an RPC connection (HTTP and websocket).
* *Web Application:* a Laravel/PHP and Vue.js framework for managing trust anchor accounts, sharing KYC data over the peer network
* *NodeJS Application:* scripts that interface the Web Application with either the Relay Node or various web3 libraries for
cryptography functions.

== Node Installer
The {url-github-veriscope-core-repo}[Veriscope GitHub repo^] comes with a complete installer that sets up a running installation complete with PostgreSQL database, nginx serving SSL connections with a reverse-proxy to backend services running
NodeJS and PHP Artisan.

To use the all-in-one setup script, you first need to provision a machine that can be reached from the internet on ports 80 and 443, with a DNS name that points to it.
//TODO Add details and recommendations

[NOTE]
If you intend to synchronize the blockchain with your Nethermind node, be mindful on the potential storage disk size. E.g. 1 million blocks requires approximately 8GB of storage.

[WARNING]
Do not continue with the setup unless you have a domain (e.g. https://subdomain.domain.com) that is reachable over ports 80 and 443.
