Releases of Veriscope occur frequently. Before deploying a release ensure you have backed up your trust anchor account (TRUST_ANCHOR_ACCOUNT) and trust anchor private key (TRUST_ANCHOR_PK). 

In the event you wish to do a clean deploy, after you complete the installation, replace the newly created trust anchor account with your backup. Then restart ta-node-1 and ta-node-2.
