= Step 7. Request to be onboarded to Mainnet
:navtitle: 7) Move to Mainnet

Once you have successfully tested the end-to-end flow with both Veriscope and other VASPs, you can request to be onboarded to mainnet. Please reach-out to your Veriscope contact or email mailto:veriscope@shyft.network[veriscope@shyft.network].

[NOTE]
Each VASP must sign & return the **Veriscope Information Form (VIF)** before being onboarded to mainnet. This will be provided on your request to move to mainnet.
