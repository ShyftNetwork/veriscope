= Step 3: Create a VASP/Trust Anchor account and request it to be verified
:navtitle: 3) Create a Trust Anchor

Creating a Trust Anchor account is done as part of the Node set-up - i.e. the previous step - yet is singled out here as a separate step as it's a common source of confusion. 

[NOTE]
The person who installed the Node should be able to provide you with the trust anchor account public/private key pair. **It is important this information is stored & shared securely.**

Once you have these details, please request your trust anchor account to be verified on tesnet by providing your Veriscope contact with the corresponding **public key**. 

Once verified, at least 1 SHFT test tokens will be transferred to the account to facilitate testing.
