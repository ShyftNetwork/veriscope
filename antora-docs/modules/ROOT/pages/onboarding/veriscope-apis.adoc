= Step 6: Implement the Veriscope APIs and Business Logic
:navtitle: 6) Implement APIs

Please follow the instructions on GitHub at https://github.com/ShyftNetwork/veriscope/tree/main/API-Docs

[NOTE]
Veriscope now offers several https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/[[Postman Collections] and Environments (JSON files) for a quicker and easier usage of the Veriscope RESTful APIs. You only need to import and set up with your own API and secret keys to begin.
