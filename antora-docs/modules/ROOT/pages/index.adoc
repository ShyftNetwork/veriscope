= Welcome to the Veriscope
:navtitle: Welcome

Veriscope is a decentralized, open-source protocol and solution to the https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf[FATF's Travel Rule] requirement. Veriscope is built on the Shyft Network.

These docs will guide you through Veriscope and how to onboard as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP).

[NOTE]
These docs are a work in progress. The goal is to consolidate all documentation on this site, however, that is not yet the case. Your feedback is welcome.
