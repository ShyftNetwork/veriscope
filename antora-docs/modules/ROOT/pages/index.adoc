Veriscope is a decentralized, open-source protocol and solution to the FATF Travel Rule requirement. 

These docs will guide you through everything you need to know about the Travel Rule and how to onboard your VASP on the network.

[NOTE]
These docs are not yet all encompassing and thus you will find links to other sites (e.g. GitHub) as you read through. It is our goal to consolidate all docs on this site in the near future.
