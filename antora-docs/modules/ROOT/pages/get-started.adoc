= How to onboard to Veriscope as a VASP
:navtitle: Get Started

There are several steps a VASP needs to complete to join the Veriscope network and meet Travel Rule obligations. These are outlined below.

== VASP Onboarding Steps

. Review & sign Veriscope agreements
. Install & run a Node
. Create a VASP/Trust Anchor account and request it to be verified
. Login to Node Dashboard and submit VASP IVMS data
. Register VASP Discovery Layer data
. Implement Veriscope APIs and related business logic
. Test the end-to-end flow
. Request to be onboarded to mainnet

Once the above is done, a VASP will be able to:

* Post attestations (i.e. an intent to withdraw funds to a particular address)
* Listen & respond to attestations on relevant (deposit) addresses
* Initate & share data peer-to-peer between VASPs
